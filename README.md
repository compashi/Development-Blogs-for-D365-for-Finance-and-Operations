### Introduction

Dynamics AX is among the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) products of the Microsoft Dynamics family. The latest AX product, currently known as AX7 or D365 was released in February 2016, which revamped the whole system by providing a cloud-based solution. The latest platform update was released in November 2017 and is known as update 12 (build number 7.0.4709).

### What is X++

X++ is an Object oriented programming language which is used to write application logic in Axapta (long for AX). X++ is flexible and optimized for creation and modification of business objects. X++ language is integrated with SQL syntax, i.e. there is no need to setup a database connection to query a database. Lastly, X++ is also used for creating forms, generating reports, integrating services, implementing workflows and customize elements according to user's need. 

X++ is created on C++. The C++ kernel code isn't available but X++ source code is open-sourced to the community. Packages are there to assist developers in reusability rather than restarting their development from scratch each time. Even though X++ is a programming language, it doesn't support inheritance with all type of object types.
